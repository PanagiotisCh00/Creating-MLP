# MachineLearningRepo
This is a repository for some machine learning projects i did in CS 442: Machine Learning course in university of Cyprus. 
In the first project (MLP.py) i created a feed forward Neural Network in python that calculates the XOR function. The method of learning is Back Propagation (on-line update with momentum).
